\title{Runs simulations on an outbreak GAM/GAMM for the purpose of predicting
scalar outbreak outcomes, and returns predicted scalar outcome values for each simulation.}
\usage{
outbreak.estimate.scalars.sample(model, time, outcomes, samples = 100)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{model returned by \code{\link[mgcv]{gam}} or \code{\link[mgcv]{gamm}}}

\item{time}{time values at which the model will be evaluated during simulation}

\item{outcomes}{scalar outcome generator function; see \code{\link{outbreak.estimate.scalars}} for more info}

\item{samples}{number of simulations to run}
}
\value{
data frame with one row for each simulation; each row has \code{outbreak.sample} column giving
a unique ID for the simulation, and one column for each scalar outcome returned by \code{outcomes}
}
\description{
This is mainly used internally by \code{outbreak.estimate.scalars}, but it's
useful if you want to calculate summary statistics of simulation results other than
the ones returned by \code{outbreak.estimate.scalars}.
