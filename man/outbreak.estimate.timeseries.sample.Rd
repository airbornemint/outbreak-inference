\title{Runs simulations on an outbreak GAM/GAMM for the purpose of predicting time series outbreak outcomes, and
returns predicted time series outcomes for each simulation.}
\usage{
outbreak.estimate.timeseries.sample(model, time, outcome, samples = 100)
}
\arguments{
\item{model}{model returned by \code{\link[mgcv]{gam}} or \code{\link[mgcv]{gamm}}}

\item{time}{time values at which the model will be evaluated during simulation}

\item{outcome}{time series outcome generator function; see \code{\link{outbreak.estimate.timeseries}} for more info}

\item{samples}{number of simulations to run}
}
\value{
matrix with one row for each simulation; each row contains the
time series calculated by \code{outcome} for the corresponding simulation run
}
\description{
This is mainly used internally by \code{outbreak.estimate.timeseries}, but
it's useful if you want to calculate summary statistics of simulation results other
than the ones returned by \code{outbreak.estimate.timeseries}.
